JBoss Log Manager Extended
============

This provides some extended support for the JBoss Log Manager. These are experiments that may eventually make it into
the [JBoss Log Manager](https://github.com/jboss-logging/jboss-logmanager). Items that make it into the JBoss Log Manager
will be deprecated for at most one release before they are removed.
